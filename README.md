This repository contains the implementation of **PolyA-GLM**, a computational framework for predicting polyadenylation sites using genome language models. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art Genome Language Models (DNABERT2, Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA) to identify poly(A) sites with high accuracy through both few-shot classification and fine-tuning approaches. **Notably, PolyA-GLM introduces the first comprehensive framework for de novo discovery of novel polyadenylation sites across the entire human genome, validated through systematic signal perturbation experiments and attention analysis to ensure biological relevance.**
